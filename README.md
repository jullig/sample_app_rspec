# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is a version of the sample application sample_app for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This version deviates from the tutorial in not using Capybara due to its dependency on Nokogiri, which as of mid June 2013 was not yet available for 64-bit Windows.
